							<span>></span> Monthly average balance
						</h2>

						<p>Monthly Average Balance is the minimum amount of funds that
							account holders must maintain to avoid being penalized by the
							bank.</p>

						<h2>
							<span>></span>Every day should maintain MAB
						</h2>

						<p>No. Since the daily closing balance is averaged out, the
							account holder may have more funds than MAB (Minimum average
							balance) on some days that can make up for the short fall on some
							days.</p>

						<h2>
							<span>></span> MAB calculated by the bank
						</h2>

						<p>
							Banks use the formula to calculate the MAB:<br> <br> <b>
								Total end of the day closing balances </b> <br>&ensp;---------------------------------------------------
							<br> <b> &emsp;&ensp; Number of days in one month </b>
